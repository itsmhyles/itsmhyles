ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mhyles 

ðŸŒ± I'm a Computer Science graduate student at Boston University, and I love solving a good problem
ðŸ‘€ I have about 3-4 years of experience in the world of product, tech, and finance. I originally was an accounting student who realized she liked making things efficient, hence the pivot to CS.
ðŸ’» I have also explored different roles in the realm of business such as strategy, product, and finance, and can deliver solutions that stakeholders not just want but do need.
